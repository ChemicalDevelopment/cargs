# FractalRender 0.1.0

## What is FractalRender

FractalRender is a program that creates fractal images, animations, and other utilities. It supports GPU acceleration, and MPI for multithreaded animation.

### Who is it for?

This is not the easiest fractal program out there, but it is extremely fast. It is for people looking to compute long videos of fractal zooms.

It can be ran on cluster computers with `mpirun`, or `aprun`, and use GPU acceleration through OpenCL. It can also go to arbitrary zoom levels (past 2^64), using GMP and the `-p` switch.

## How can I use it?

Well, just follow the [quick start guide](./#/quickstart), and start going!
